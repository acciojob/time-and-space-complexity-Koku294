	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is an important aspect of algorithm analysis, determining how efficient an algorithm is in terms of its execution time based on the input size.</p>
    
    <p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm uses relative to the input size, often denoted as O(n). <b>Space Complexity</b> is essential for evaluating an algorithm's performance with larger datasets.</p>
